					The Afghanistan Spatial Data Center (ASDC) is developed by iMMAP in Afghanistan. It is part of the iMMAP Disaster Risk Reduction Program, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).
					</p>
					<p>
					The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) program is a scientific program that supports the humanitarian community with critical information to aid decision makers in emergency response or program development. The Afghanistan Spatial Data Center (ASDC) is the dissemination platform for DRR data and other baseline information. At present the ASDC is the most advanced geoportal on Afghanistan containing comprehensive and accurate data. The iMMAP DRR program is funded by USAID and it is ready for daily usage. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The information provided on ASDC are especially useful in regards to forecasting, emergency response, M&E and planning purposes.

					<p>Dr. Emlyn Hagen has led the development of the ASDC conceptually and scientifically. At one hand creating the various unique data sets utilised by the project, as well as developing the scientific methodology for the forecasting and statistics.</p>

					<p class="lead">{% trans "GeoNode Developer" %}</p>
					<p>Mr. Budi Hermansyah has created the ASDC GeoNode portal. Which is an advanced and further development of the GeoNode supported by the World Bank. These advancements include the creation of all statistics and user interfaces, statistics, POI’s models, as well as automated data retrieval and analysis for forecasting purposes. Furthermore, an advanced dashboard has been created by Mr Budi Hermansyah.</p>

					<p class="lead">Information Management Officer and Training and Outreach</p>
					<p>Noor Zangana has led the dedicated training program of users on the ASDC since July 2016. She is supported by two local nationals in this effort. The training program is further supported by videos as well as a certification process. </p>
